// Design your implementation of the singly linked list.  A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: val and next. val is the value of the current node, and next is a pointer/reference to the next node. (manual evaulation)

// Implement these functions in your linked list:

// get(index) : Get the value of the index-th node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1.
// addAtHead(val) : Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.
// addAtTail(val) : Append a node of value val to the last element of the linked list.
// addAtIndex(index, val) : Add a node of value val before the index-th node in the linked list. If index equals to the length of linked list, the node will be appended to the end of linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.
// deleteAtIndex(index) : Delete the index-th node in the linked list, if the index is valid. in c language ?
